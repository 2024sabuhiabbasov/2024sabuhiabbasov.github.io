			<h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I'm Sabuhi, a high school student at <a href="https://uwcisak.jp/" style="color:#737272;text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="UWC ISAK Japan">UWC ISAK Japan</a>. My passion for tech started with computer science, where I discovered the limitless possibilities of creating anything I could imagine. I've honed my skills in web design, learning <span style="color:#737272;">WIX</span> during my two-year stint at Kekalove Adoptive Fashion. I've also participated in hackathons and developed skills in <span style="color:#737272;">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#737272;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color:#737272;">Python</span>. In addition, I've been doing <span style="color:#737272;">competitive programming</span> for about two years, which has allowed me to become skilled in <span style="color:#737272;">C</span> and <span style="color:#737272;">C++</span>. I'm pursuing <span style="color:#737272;">Computer Science</span> as part of my IB program and apply my skills in real-world projects. In my free time, I stay up to date with the latest tech advancements and try new programming languages and frameworks. I'm excited to share my tech experiences and inspire others through this blog.
